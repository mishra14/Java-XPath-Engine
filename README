This repository is for a Java based xpath enigine based on the following grammar -

 XPath  ->  axis step          
 axis  ->  /          
 step  ->  nodename ([ test ])* (axis step)?           
 test  ->  step   
       ->  text() = "..."   
       ->  contains(text(), "...")   
       ->  @attname = "..."  

where nodename and attname are valid XML identifiers, and "..." indicates a quoted string. 
This means that a query like /db/record/name[text() = "Alice"] is valid 
But the similar (and valid XPath) query /db/record/child::name[text() = "Bob"] is not. 
Below are some examples of valid XPaths that you need to support :  
 /foo/bar/xyz   /foo/bar[@att="123"]   /xyz/abc[contains(text(),"someSubstring")]   /a/b/c[text()="theEntireText"]   /blah[anotherElement]   /this/that[something/else]   /d/e/f[foo[text()="something"]][bar]  /a/b/c[text() =   "whiteSpacesShouldNotMatter"]
